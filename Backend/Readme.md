### <h1>AI-Powered Cybersecurity Threat Detection System - Backend</h1>
This README provides an overview of the backend structure for the AI-Powered Cybersecurity Threat Detection System. The backend is built using **Python** and **Flask/Django** to handle API requests, manage data processing, and facilitate the interaction between the machine learning models and the frontend. It enables real-time detection and logging of network anomalies.

### <h1>Project Structure</h1>

The backend directory is organized as follows:
```bash
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py           # Initialize Flask/Django app and configuration
│   ├── config.py             # Configuration settings (e.g., database, environment)
│   ├── models/               # Database models
│   │   ├── Threat.py
│   │   └── User.py
│   ├── routes/               # API endpoints
│   │   ├── alerts.py
│   │   ├── auth.py
│   │   └── reports.py
│   ├── services/             # Core logic for threat detection and ML model integration
│   │   ├── anomaly_detection.py
│   │   ├── data_processing.py
│   │   └── notification.py
│   ├── utils/                # Helper functions and utility scripts
│   │   ├── db.py
│   │   └── logger.py
│   ├── tests/                # Unit and integration tests
│   │   ├── test_routes.py
│   │   └── test_models.py
│   └── main.py               # Main entry point for running the app
├── requirements.txt          # Project dependencies
├── .env                      # Environment variables (e.g., API keys, database URLs)
├── README.md                 # Documentation (this file)
└── run.py                    # Script to run the application
```

### <h1>Folder Structure Details</h1>
1. **app/**
   - **init.py**: Initializes the Flask/Django application, configures extensions, and registers blueprints for modular routing.
  
   - **config.py**: Stores configuration settings, such as database URI, API keys, and environment-based settings.
  
   - **models/**: Contains database models defining data structure and relationships.
     - **Threat.py**: Defines the structure of threat logs, including details like threat type, timestamp, and severity.
     - **User.py**: Defines user data for authentication, including roles and permissions for secure access to the system.
   
   - **routes/**: Stores all API routes organized by function.
     - **alerts.py**: Manages routes for threat alerting and status updates.
     - **auth.py**: Handles authentication-related endpoints, such as login and user management.
     - **reports.py**: Provides endpoints to generate and retrieve historical threat reports.
   
   - **services/**: Contains core logic for threat detection and integrates with machine learning models.
     - **anomaly_detection.py**: Hosts the AI and machine learning models used for anomaly detection, including model loading, prediction, and processing logic.
     - **data_processing.py**: Contains methods for processing and cleaning incoming network log data before feeding it to models.
     - **notification.py**: Handles notifications, including triggering alerts for detected threats and sending them to the frontend.
   
   - **utils/**: Utility functions that assist with logging, database connections, and other backend tasks.
     - **db.py**: Database connection functions, including setup and teardown.
     - **logger.py**: Custom logging configurations for standardized logging across the backend.
   
   - **tests/**: Holds unit and integration tests for routes, services, and database models.
     - **test_routes.py**: Tests for API endpoints to verify data integrity, security, and response structure.
     - **test_models.py**: Tests for database models, ensuring correct schema structure and integrity.
   
   - **main.py**: Main application entry file that runs the server. It initializes the app, loads configuration, and starts the web server.

2. **requirements.txt**
   - Lists all Python packages and dependencies required for running the backend. This includes Flask/Django, machine learning libraries, database connectors, etc.

3. **.env**
   - Stores sensitive configuration data, such as API keys, database URIs, and other environment-specific variables. This file is excluded from version control for security.

4. **run.py**
   - A script to launch the application in various modes (e.g., development, production).

### <h1>Getting Started</h1>
**Prerequisites**
  - **Python 3.x**
  - **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL** (based on database choice)

**Installation**
1. Clone this repository.
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  cd <repository-directory>
  ```
2. Install the dependencies.
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3. Configure environment variables in the `.env` file.

4. Run the application.
  ```bash
  python run.py
  ```

### <h1>Key Dependencies</h1>

  - **Flask/Django**: Framework for building APIs.
  - **SQLAlchemy or Django ORM**: Database ORM for PostgreSQL/MongoDB integration.
  - **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For machine learning model implementation.
  - **Scikit-Learn**: For supporting algorithms used in anomaly detection.
  - **JWT**: For handling secure user authentication.
  
### <h1>API Overview</h1>
The backend provides several RESTful API endpoints for interacting with the frontend:
1. **/auth/**
   - `POST /login`: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.
   - `POST /register`: Registers a new user (restricted access).

2. **/alerts/**
   - `GET /alerts`: Fetches a list of recent alerts.
   - `POST /alerts`: Adds a new alert from a detected threat.
   - `PUT /alerts/{id}`: Updates an alert's status.

3. **/reports/**
   - `GET /reports`: Generates a report based on specified time frames or filters.

4. **/threat-detection/**
   - `POST /predict`: Takes in network data, processes it, and returns anomaly predictions.

### <h1>Testing</h1>
