# AI-Powered-Cyber-Threat-Detection-System
###
## Problem: _Growing cybersecurity threats make manual threat detection inefficient._
Solution: A system that uses machine learning models to detect and flag anomalous network traffic or security breaches in real-time, using AI.
###
## Technology:
**Frontend**: React.js for the dashboard interface.

**Backend**: Python-based threat detection models, Flask/Django for APIs.

**Algorithms**: Anomaly detection, neural networks, or reinforcement learning for threat detection.

**Database**: MongoDB/PostgreSQL.

###

**_Need_**: Organizations are constantly at risk from new and evolving threats, making real-time, AI-driven solutions increasingly critical.

**_Guidance_**: Collect data from network logs and use unsupervised learning to detect anomalies.

You can integrate it with a dashboard that provides real-time alerts and detailed reports.
